# FlowClub
Flow Club is a professional platform designed to facilitate seamless collaboration and communication among developers. Each user has a personal account that, upon logging in, provides immediate access to a centralized calendar of all upcoming collaborative sessions. The platform allows you to efficiently manage your projects by offering key features: easily schedule new meetings with your team, set new project goals for you and your team to track, and edit your profile to make it discoverable to other developers who may wish to add you to a project. During meetings, you have flexible communication options, including the ability to enable your camera for video conferencing or use the integrated chat function for text-based communication.
